Support both monochrome and multi-color rendering modes

General web projects requiring sci-fi industrial iconography

Originally designed in 1978 for Ridley Scott’s Alien (1979). Published in Cobb’s art book Colorvision (1981). The icons use a consistent design language: rounded-rectangle frames with a separator line dividing a symbolic

Cobb’s color system carries semantic meaning — red signals danger/alert, yellow marks active energy processes, blue indicates cold/cryogenic, white/grey denotes habitable life-support areas, and black means vacuum/death.

4.2 Three Rendering Tiers

The font system supports three rendering modes, each suited to different contexts:

Layer A (Frame): The outer rounded-rectangle border, separator line, and any structural frame elements. Typically rendered in the Cobb category color (red, yellow, blue, etc.)

For full Cobb-fidelity rendering (ArtemisOps kiosks, large format displays), generate a multi-color SVG sprite sheet alongside the font. Each icon is a <symbol> element with its authentic color fills:

This section identifies icon families where Cobb’s originals rely on color to distinguish between related icons, and defines structural modifications to ensure each icon is uniquely identifiable in monochrome. These modi

To preserve the semantic layer that color normally carries, each icon receives a small corner badge indicating its Cobb color category. These badges are structural marks in the monochrome glyph that allow a trained user 

Separator line: Horizontal divider approximately 1/3 from the top, creating a label zone above and a symbol zone below

White outline: All icons should be outlined in white when appearing on dark or colored backgrounds

Grid: Originally drawn on graph paper; icons should maintain pixel-grid alignment for crisp rendering

Toggle between Tier 1 (monochrome), Tier 2 (duotone), and Tier 3 (full SVG) rendering modes

The webfont should be hosted locally in the ArtemisOps static assets directory for offline kiosk support (consistent with the existing Tabler Icons and Space Mono/IBM Plex Sans local hosting approach). The kiosk screens
