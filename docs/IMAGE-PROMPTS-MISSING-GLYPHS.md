## U+E04D — Fire Suppression  _(Tier 2, Red/Yellow)_

**Context:** Fire is a major Isolation gameplay element — fire as weapon, fire traps, flamethrower as primary defence. No Cobb icon addresses fire hazard or suppression.

**Symbol guidance:** A flame silhouette (teardrop with inner twist) with a diagonal suppression bar across it, or a fire extinguisher silhouette with spray arc. Reads as 'fire hazard / suppression system', not general hazard (#012).

**Image prompt:**

> Hand-drawn icon design for 'Fire Suppression' — a pictographic glyph for the Semiotic Standard, the spacecraft signage system from Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) designed by Ron Cobb. Context: Fire is a major Isolation gameplay element — fire as weapon, fire traps, flamethrower as primary defence. A flame silhouette (teardrop with inner twist) with a diagonal suppression bar across it, or a fire extinguisher silhouette with spray arc. Reads as 'fire hazard / suppression system', not general hazard (#012). Hand-drawn on white paper with black ink, realistic pencil/marker sketch. Square icon with a thick rounded-rectangle border. A horizontal separator line divides the frame: a narrow label zone at the bottom and a large symbol zone above. The symbol is bold, minimal, and structurally legible at small sizes. Style reference: Ron Cobb's 1978 Semiotic Standard icons for Ridley Scott's Alien — stark, industrial, modernist pictograms for a commercial spacecraft. No color, no shading, no texture — only clean black line art on white. The icon must read clearly at 64px in a single flat color.

## U+E04E — Ventilation / Ductwork  _(Tier 1, White/Yellow)_

**Context:** Ventilation systems are THE defining environmental feature of the Alien franchise. Vents are how the Xenomorph moves, how Dallas dies, how players navigate Isolation. Despite being the franchise's most iconic infrastructure, Cobb made no ventilation glyph.

**Symbol guidance:** A circular fan blade (4 or 6 blades) in plan view, or a rectangular duct opening with a grid grille pattern and airflow arrows pointing outward. Must immediately read as 'vent / duct / airflow' — this is the most important missing icon.

## U+E04F — Temperature Warning  _(Tier 3, Yellow/Red)_

**Context:** Cobb covers cold (Blue: cryogenics #004, refrigeration #019) but not heat warnings. Thermal hazards — reactor areas, exhaust zones — have no icon.

**Symbol guidance:** A thermometer silhouette with the bulb at bottom and a fill level near the top, with radiating heat lines to the right. Or: a thermometer with a flame beneath the bulb. Must read 'high temperature / heat hazard' rather than just 'temperature measurement'.

## U+E050 — Elevator / Lift  _(Tier 1, Red/White)_

**Context:** Cobb has Ladderway (#027) for vertical transit via ladder. Elevators are powered mechanical systems — a key interactive element in Isolation (elevator buttons, shaft navigation). No Cobb glyph despite elevators appearing in every franchise location.

**Symbol guidance:** A square cabin shape with an up-arrow and down-arrow on either side, or a rectangular box with a vertical shaft line above and below it. The universal 'elevator' symbol — must be distinct from Ladderway (#027).

## U+E051 — Stairway  _(Tier 2, White/Grey)_

**Context:** Cobb has Ladderway (#027) specifically for ladder access. Stairs are a different mode of vertical movement present throughout every franchise location. The Steam guide notes Isolation has a stairway semiotic icon variant in-game.

**Symbol guidance:** A side-view staircase — a stepped profile of 3–5 descending steps with a handrail line above them. ISO 7001 convention but drawn in Cobb's bold line weight.

## U+E052 — Transit Hub / Station  _(Tier 2, Red)_

**Context:** Sevastopol's Towerlink tram system connects the three towers — transit stations are major navigation waypoints and named Isolation areas. Marks the transit facility itself, not a directional arrow.

**Symbol guidance:** A tram or monorail car silhouette on a horizontal track line, or two parallel track rails with a central platform shape. Reads as 'transit / tram / station', not general wayfinding.

**Image prompt:**

## U+E053 — Surveillance Camera  _(Tier 1, Yellow/Red)_

**Context:** Security cameras are a core Isolation mechanic — the player can toggle camera feeds via rewire panels, and cameras trigger alarms. A distinct controllable subsystem with no Cobb equivalent.

**Symbol guidance:** A CCTV camera silhouette — rectangular body with a lens protrusion at front and a mounting arm at back. May include a small indicator light dot. Reads as 'security camera / surveillance', not Antenna (#042) or AI Core (#054).

## U+E054 — AI Core / Mainframe  _(Tier 1, Yellow/Red)_

**Context:** MU/TH/UR 6000 (Alien), APOLLO Core (Isolation), GERTY (Moon) — AI mainframes are autonomous systems with dedicated physical spaces and access restrictions. Cobb's Computer Terminal (#030) is a user workstation; this is the AI system itself.

**Symbol guidance:** A circuit-board brain shape — a hemisphere or rounded square with lines suggesting neural pathways or circuit traces, or a bold 'chip' square with connector lines on all four sides. Must read as 'artificial intelligence / autonomous system'.

**Image prompt:**

## U+E055 — Alarm / Alert System  _(Tier 1, Red)_

**Context:** Alarms are a rewire-panel-controllable system in Isolation — activate/deactivate to manipulate enemy behaviour. Cobb's Hazard Warning (#012) is a static sign; this is an active alert system.

**Symbol guidance:** A bell silhouette with radiating vibration lines on both sides, or a rotating emergency light (dome shape with radial flash lines). Must read as 'active alarm / siren', not a static warning sign.

## U+E056 — Emergency / Self-Destruct  _(Tier 3, Red/Black)_

**Context:** The Nostromo self-destruct, atmosphere processor countdown, Sevastopol reactor purge — franchise-defining moments. Emergency override and catastrophic system states. The ultimate red-button icon.

**Symbol guidance:** A bold exclamation mark inside a triangle (ISO general warning convention) but with a Cobb-style frame, or a skull-and-crossbones simplified to extreme boldness. Alternatively: a large X with a circle around it suggesting 'terminate / override'. Must read as 'catastrophic / irreversible action'.

**Image prompt:**

## U+E057 — Mining / Extraction  _(Tier 3, Yellow)_

**Context:** Moon (2009): Gavin Rothery created 16 Cobb-extension icons for Sarang Base's He-3 mining. The Nostromo is a commercial ore towing vessel. Mining/extraction is the economic foundation of the franchise universe but has no Cobb glyph.

**Symbol guidance:** A pickaxe or drill bit silhouette, or a simplified excavation arm shape. Bold and geometric — must read as 'resource extraction / mining industry'.

**Image prompt:**
