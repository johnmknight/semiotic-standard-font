# Missing Core Glyphs — Semiotic Standard

**Cross-Reference Analysis: Canon Franchise Interfaces × Computing UI Iconography**

_Companion to Webfont Build Specification v1.1 — Extended Set (Section 3.2)_
# 1. Methodology
This analysis identifies missing glyphs by cross-referencing three data domains against the 30 original Cobb icons and the existing Extended Set proposals in the webfont spec:
- Canon in-universe locations and systems: Named areas, interactive systems, and environmental signage visible across Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), Alien: Isolation (2014), Prometheus (2012), Alien: Romulus (2024), Alien: Rogue Incursion (2024), and Moon (2009, Rothery’s Cobb extension).
- Canon computer interfaces: MU/TH/UR 6000 terminal functions, Isolation’s rewire panel subsystems (door access, camera feed, air purification, speaker system, alarm), APOLLO Core systems, Seegson terminal UI, and Moon’s GERTY interface and Sarang base monitoring screens.
- Standard UI/computing iconography: ISO 7001/7010 safety pictograms, common software UI icon conventions (navigation, status, communication, security), and industrial HMI symbology that would logically exist in a standardized spacecraft signage system.
An icon is flagged as “missing” when all three conditions are met: (a) the concept appears as a named location, interactive system, or visible signage in canon; (b) no existing Cobb glyph adequately covers it; and (c) a recognizable UI/computing parallel exists, confirming the concept belongs in a functional pictographic standard.
# 2. Gap Analysis Summary
Cobb’s original 30 icons were designed for a commercial towing vessel (the Nostromo) in a pre-digital era. The set excels at physical environment labeling: pressure states, temperature zones, radiation levels, basic wayfinding, and a handful of facilities. But it has systematic blind spots in areas that became central to later franchise entries and that any real spacecraft standard would require:
Digital infrastructure: Cobb has exactly one computing icon (#030 Computer Terminal). No network, server, AI, surveillance, or data icons despite MU/TH/UR, APOLLO, and GERTY being central to their respective stories.
Active systems control: The rewire panel in Isolation breaks systems into controllable subsystems (cameras, alarms, air purification, speakers, door access) that have no Cobb equivalents. These are the franchise’s most granular depiction of shipboard systems management.
Security and emergency: No security checkpoint, quarantine, emergency exit, or self-destruct icons despite these being franchise-defining concepts.
Biological hazard: The franchise IS about biological hazard, yet Cobb only covers radiation and general hazard. The biohazard trefoil is completely absent.
Vertical transit: Only ladderway exists. No elevator/lift icon despite elevators being in every franchise location and a core Isolation gameplay mechanic.
Ventilation: The most iconic infrastructure element of the entire Alien franchise has no glyph whatsoever.
Living spaces: Galley and Coffee cover food prep, but no crew quarters, recreation, hygiene, or cargo icons.
Mining/industry: The Nostromo is a commercial ore hauler. Moon is about He-3 mining. No extraction or industrial process icons.

# 3. Complete Missing Glyphs Registry
28 proposed glyphs, ordered by PUA assignment within the U+E030–E05F extended range. Color-coded rows indicate Cobb color category.

| PUA | Proposed Glyph Name | Cobb Color | Category | Canon Evidence | UI/Computing Parallel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U+E031 | Security Checkpoint | Red | Access & Security | Sevastopol has dedicated security checkpoints (Colonial Marshal Bureau, Seegson Security). No Cobb glyph exists for a security/checkpoint concept. Rewire panels control security cameras and alarms — the camera/surveillance concept has no icon. | Shield / Lock icon (universal computing: authentication, access control) |
| U+E032 | Emergency Exit | Red | Access & Security | Sevastopol and all franchise vessels have emergency evacuation routes. Cobb has directional arrows (020A–D) but no dedicated emergency egress icon distinct from wayfinding. | Exit / Running-figure icon (ISO 7010 E001/E002, universal emergency signage) |
| U+E033 | Quarantine Zone | Red/Yellow | Access & Security | Quarantine is a major narrative element across the franchise (Ash breaking quarantine in Alien, entire medical wing lockdowns in Isolation). No Cobb icon addresses biological containment zones. | Biohazard-in-circle / restricted-zone icon |
| U+E034 | Decontamination | Yellow/White | Access & Security | Decontamination rooms appear physically in Isolation (player walks through them in KG-348 labs). Distinct from quarantine — this is a process/facility, not a restricted zone. | Shower/spray icon with containment frame |
| U+E035 | Medical Bay / Infirmary | Red/White | Medical & Science | Cobb’s #025 Autodoc is a specific device (automated surgical unit). There is no general medical facility icon. San Cristobal is an entire hospital wing with crisis stabilization, primary care, morgue, and surgery. The franchise clearly needs both “autodoc device” and “medical area.” | Cross / Plus symbol (universal medical, Red Cross convention) |
| U+E036 | Laboratory / Research | Yellow | Medical & Science | Research laboratories are key locations in Isolation (entire KG-348 wing), Prometheus, and Covenant. Distinct from medical — this is science/analysis, not treatment. No Cobb glyph covers this. | Flask / Beaker icon (standard science/lab indicator) |
| U+E037 | Biohazard | Yellow/Red | Medical & Science | The entire franchise is fundamentally about biological hazard. Cobb has radiation hazards (016–018) and general hazard (012) but no biological hazard specifically. The international biohazard trefoil is conspicuously absent from the original 30. | Biohazard trefoil (ISO, universal) |
| U+E038 | Reactor / Power Core | Red/Yellow | Engineering & Power | Nuclear/fusion reactors are critical to every vessel and station in the franchise. The Nostromo’s self-destruct IS the reactor. Sevastopol’s reactor is a major gameplay area. Cobb has no power generation icon — only downstream systems (photonic, astronic, laser). | Atom / Power symbol (energy generation in industrial UI) |
| U+E039 | Power Distribution / Electrical | Yellow | Engineering & Power | Rewire panels (power routing UI) are a core game mechanic in Isolation — the player constantly redistributes power between door access, cameras, air purification, speakers, and alarms. “High Voltage” signage appears in-game. No Cobb icon for electrical/power distribution. | Lightning bolt / Plug icon (universal power/electrical) |
| U+E040 | Engine Room | Yellow | Engineering & Power | Engineering sections are present on every franchise vessel. Cobb has no propulsion/engine icon. The engineering platform on Sevastopol is a distinct area type. | Gear / Turbine icon (mechanical systems) |
| U+E041 | Fuel System | Yellow/Red | Engineering & Power | Fuel handling is central to Moon’s entire premise (He-3 mining). Nostromo is literally a fuel refinery tug. Rothery extended Cobb’s language specifically for Moon’s fuel systems. No original Cobb glyph. | Fuel pump / Drop icon |
| U+E042 | Antenna / Comms Array | Yellow | Communications & Data | Cobb has Intercom (#028) for local point-to-point communication. But long-range/external communications arrays are major plot elements (Isolation’s entire Seegson Comms tower, Moon’s sabotaged comms). No icon for broadcast/receive antenna systems. | Antenna / Signal-bars / Satellite-dish icon (universal comms) |
| U+E043 | Network Hub / Data Terminal | Yellow | Communications & Data | Cobb has Computer Terminal (#030) for a user-facing workstation. But Isolation distinguishes between terminals, servers, and network infrastructure (APOLLO Core, Server Farm, Server Hub). The franchise clearly differentiates user terminals from backend infrastructure. | Server rack / Network-nodes icon (IT infrastructure) |
| U+E044 | Emergency Beacon / Distress | Red | Communications & Data | Distress beacons drive the plot of nearly every Alien film. This is functionally distinct from comms (passive broadcast vs. active communication). No Cobb glyph. | SOS / Pulsing-signal icon |
| U+E045 | Crew Quarters / Berth | White/Grey | Crew & Living | Cobb has Galley (#022) and Coffee (#023) for communal areas, and Cryogenic Vault (#004) for hibernation. But no general crew quarters/sleeping berth icon. Every vessel has dedicated living space distinct from these. | Bed / House icon (accommodation) |
| U+E046 | Mess Hall / Recreation | White/Grey | Crew & Living | Cobb’s Galley (#022) is specifically a kitchen/food-prep area. Recreation and communal dining are different. Isolation has a full galleria mall and recreation areas. Moon has Sam’s rec room. No icon. | Utensils / People-group icon |
| U+E047 | Hygiene / Shower | White/Grey | Crew & Living | Romulus literally introduced a “Slippery when wet” icon for wet areas. Hygiene facilities appear in crew areas across the franchise. No Cobb original. | Shower head / Water-drop icon |
| U+E048 | Cargo Bay / Hold | Grey | Crew & Living | Cobb has Storage Non-Organic (#029) and Storage Organic (#029A) for stored materials. But cargo bays/holds are large-scale spaces, not storage lockers. Freight Shipping is a named area in Isolation. | Box / Container icon (logistics) |
| U+E049 | EVA Preparation | White/Red | EVA & External | E.V.A. Preparation is a specifically named area in Isolation. Cobb has Pressure Suit Locker (#008) for storing suits, but EVA prep is the staging area for extravehicular activity — suit-up, checks, depressurization sequence. Functionally distinct. | Astronaut / Helmet icon |
| U+E04A | Docking Port | Red/White | EVA & External | Docking is a critical operation in every franchise entry. Isolation has multiple docking scenarios. Airlock (#005) handles atmosphere sealing but not the mechanical docking interface itself. | Link / Connector icon (interface/coupling) |
| U+E04B | Observation / Viewport | White/Grey | EVA & External | Observation areas with external viewports are present in Isolation (named Observation Deck) and Moon. Not the same as Bridge (#024), which is a command center. No Cobb icon for viewing areas. | Eye / Window icon |
| U+E04C | Oxygen / Atmosphere | White/Red | Environmental Systems | Cobb’s Life Support (#021) is a broad system icon. But Isolation’s rewire panels specifically break out “air purification” as a controllable subsystem. O2 level monitoring is a distinct UI function from general life support. | O₂ / Lungs / Wind icon (air quality monitoring) |
| U+E04D | Fire Suppression | Red/Yellow | Environmental Systems | Fire is a major gameplay element in Isolation (fire as weapon, fire traps as plot devices, flamethrower as primary defense). No Cobb icon addresses fire suppression/fire hazard specifically. | Flame / Fire-extinguisher icon |
| U+E04E | Ventilation / Ductwork | White/Yellow | Environmental Systems | Ventilation systems are THE defining environmental feature of the franchise. Vents are how the Xenomorph moves, how the player navigates, how Dallas dies. Despite being the franchise’s most iconic infrastructure element, there is no Cobb glyph for ventilation or duct access. | Fan / Airflow-arrows icon (HVAC) |
| U+E04F | Temperature Warning | Yellow/Red | Environmental Systems | Cobb covers cold (Blue: cryogenics, refrigeration) but not heat warnings. Temperature extremes on the hot end have no icon despite reactor areas, exhaust zones, and thermal hazards. | Thermometer / Flame icon (thermal alert) |
| U+E050 | Elevator / Lift | Red/White | Navigation & Transit | Cobb has Ladderway (#027) for vertical transit via ladder. Elevators/lifts are a completely different system — mechanical, powered, and a key interactive element in Isolation. No Cobb glyph. | Up-down arrows in box (universal elevator indicator) |
| U+E051 | Stairway | White/Grey | Navigation & Transit | Cobb has Ladderway (#027) specifically. Stairs are a different mode of vertical movement, present throughout every franchise location. The Steam guide notes that Isolation even has a stairway semiotic icon variant in-game. | Stairs icon (ISO 7001, universal wayfinding) |
| U+E052 | Transit Hub / Station | Red | Navigation & Transit | Sevastopol’s Towerlink tram system connects the three towers. Transit stations are major navigation waypoints and named areas. Distinct from directional arrows — this marks the transit facility itself. | Train / Tram icon (mass transit) |
| U+E053 | Surveillance Camera | Yellow/Red | Surveillance & AI | Security cameras are a core Isolation mechanic — the player can toggle camera feeds via rewire panels, and cameras can trigger alarms. This is a distinct system type with no Cobb equivalent. | Camera / Eye icon (security monitoring, universal CCTV) |
| U+E054 | AI Core / Mainframe | Yellow/Red | Surveillance & AI | Cobb’s Computer Terminal (#030) is a user workstation. But MU/TH/UR, APOLLO, and GERTY are AI mainframes — autonomous systems with their own dedicated physical spaces. APOLLO Core is a named Isolation area with its own server rooms and observation platforms. Fundamentally different from a terminal. | Brain / Chip / AI icon (artificial intelligence) |
| U+E055 | Alarm / Alert System | Red | Alarm & Status | Alarms are a rewire-panel-controllable system in Isolation — the player can activate/deactivate alarm systems to lure or avoid enemies. Cobb’s Hazard Warning (#012) is a static sign, not an active alert system. | Bell / Siren icon (alert notification, universal UI) |
| U+E056 | Emergency / Self-Destruct | Red/Black | Alarm & Status | Emergency destruct/purge procedures are franchise-defining moments. The Nostromo self-destruct, the atmosphere processor countdown, Sevastopol’s reactor purge. No Cobb icon for emergency override or catastrophic system states. | Skull / Explosion / Critical-alert icon |
| U+E057 | Mining / Extraction | Yellow | Mining & Industry | Rothery created Moon-specific semiotic icons for Sarang Base’s mining operations. The Nostromo is a commercial ore towing vessel. Mining/extraction is the economic foundation of the franchise universe but has no Cobb glyph. | Pickaxe / Drill icon (resource extraction) |
| U+E058 | Rover / Surface Vehicle | White/Yellow | Mining & Industry | Moon’s plot revolves around rover operations on the lunar surface. Prometheus uses surface vehicles for exploration. No Cobb icon for surface transport vehicles. | Vehicle / Rover icon |


# 4. Key Source Evidence by Interface System
## 4.1 Alien: Isolation — Rewire Panel Subsystems
The rewire panel is Isolation’s most granular depiction of shipboard systems. Each panel controls a subset of: Door Access, Camera Feed, Air Purification, Speaker System, Alarm. These five functions map to five missing glyphs: Security Checkpoint (access control), Surveillance Camera (camera feed), Oxygen/Atmosphere (air purification), Alarm/Alert System (alarm), and Intercom is the only one Cobb covers (#028, for speaker-like communication). The rewire panel proves these are considered distinct controllable subsystems in the franchise’s technical universe.
## 4.2 Alien: Isolation — Named Station Areas
Sevastopol’s named areas that have no Cobb icon: Seegson Communications (external comms array), APOLLO Core (AI mainframe), Server Farm and Server Hub (network infrastructure), San Cristobal Medical Facility (general medical, not just autodoc), Project KG-348 Research Labs (laboratory), E.V.A. Preparation (EVA staging), Decontamination rooms, Seegson Synthetics (manufacturing — addressed by spec’s existing proposals), Colonial Marshal Bureau (security), Solomons Galleria (recreation/commerce), Spaceflight Terminal (transit hub), and the Towerlink transit system (mass transit).
## 4.3 Alien (1979) — MU/TH/UR & Nostromo Systems
MU/TH/UR 6000 is accessed through a dedicated AI interface room restricted to command officers — functionally distinct from any general-use computer terminal. The Nostromo’s self-destruct sequence involves the reactor core (no power generation icon), emergency override procedures (no emergency/destruct icon), and the vent system through which Dallas hunts the Xenomorph (no ventilation icon). The ship is a commercial ore towing vessel and refinery (no mining/cargo icons beyond storage).
## 4.4 Moon (2009) — Rothery’s Cobb Extensions
Gavin Rothery created 16 additional semiotic standard icons for Moon’s Sarang Base, deliberately extending Cobb’s design language. These cover mining operations (He-3 harvesting), rover/surface vehicles, communications (the jammed long-range comms are a central plot element), and base facilities. Rothery’s work confirms that the original 30 are insufficient for operational environments beyond the Nostromo’s specific configuration. The KSP-Semiotic mod documents 16 Rothery icons alongside Cobb’s 34 (including direction variants). Moon’s computer, GERTY, is another AI mainframe requiring the AI Core glyph rather than a simple terminal icon.
## 4.5 Alien: Romulus (2024) & Rogue Incursion (2024)
Romulus introduced at least one entirely new semiotic icon (“Slippery when wet” for hygiene/wet areas), confirming the standard is treated as extensible within canon. Rogue Incursion included both original Cobb icons and new additions matching the design language. Both entries reinforce that the 30-icon base set is explicitly not considered complete by current franchise creators.
## 4.6 Alien: Earth (2025) — FX App Icon Set
FX Networks released 32 app icons themed as semiotic standard icons for the Alien: Earth TV series promotion. While primarily decorative, this set maps Cobb’s design language onto modern app icon conventions, further validating the cross-reference between semiotic standard iconography and contemporary UI/computing icon categories.
# 5. Implementation Priority for Webfont Spec
The following icons are recommended as highest priority for Phase 3 of the webfont build, based on frequency of appearance in canon, gameplay/UI utility, and absence of any close Cobb equivalent:
- Tier 1 (Immediate): Ventilation/Ductwork, Elevator/Lift, Medical Bay, Biohazard, Reactor/Power Core, AI Core/Mainframe, Emergency Exit, Alarm System, Surveillance Camera, Quarantine Zone
- Tier 2 (High): Power Distribution, Antenna/Comms Array, Emergency/Self-Destruct, Fire Suppression, Docking Port, Crew Quarters, Transit Hub, Stairway, Laboratory, Oxygen/Atmosphere
- Tier 3 (Complete): Decontamination, Network Hub, Emergency Beacon, Mess Hall, Hygiene/Shower, Cargo Bay, EVA Preparation, Observation/Viewport, Temperature Warning, Engine Room, Fuel System, Mining/Extraction, Rover/Surface Vehicle, Security Checkpoint
All 28 icons should be designed in Cobb’s design language (rounded-rectangle frame, separator line, structural interior symbol) and must pass the monochrome differentiation litmus test defined in Webfont Spec Section 5: uniquely identifiable at 24px in a single flat color.
— END OF ANALYSIS —
"In space, everyone can read your icons."
